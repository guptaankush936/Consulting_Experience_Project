# Consulting_Experience_Project
Project on how to approach a particular consulting problem and how to perform the analysis and provide valuable insights for the business development.
This project is basically divided into 4 different tasks:
	Performed Industry and Company analysis of Grofers, with prime focus on business development through PESTEL analysis, Porter’s 5 forces (Threats of New entrants, Threats of new Substitutes, Bargaining Power of Customers, Competitive Rivalry, Bargaining Power of Suppliers), Blue Ocean Strategy, and SWOT analysis.
	Build Warehousing Manager’s dashboard by identifying the KPIs, formulae, the form of graphical representation and the impact of KPI deviation on the overall function.
	Analyzed the sales data of e-mandi (Hypothetical startup) and figured out the reasons to conclude that its present discounting strategy based on cart value is ineffective and the new discounting strategy should be customer based and product based. Build a detailed presentation of the findings of the study, with supporting data and graphs.
